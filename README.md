# Dígitos 10 – Update Your Phonebook to Mexico’s New Dialing Format

**Easily convert all your phone numbers to the new 10-digit national dialing format.**

## Privacy
**Dígitos 10** does not store any user information. Your privacy is guaranteed.

## Overview
Starting **August 3**, Mexico will adopt a new nationwide phone dialing format:  
All landline and mobile phone numbers will have **10 digits**, removing the prefixes **044**, **045**, **01**, and **1**.

**Dígitos 10** automates this process by updating your contacts, removing outdated prefixes, and adding the **+52** country code (which does not affect the new dialing system).  
Additionally, you can enter your city’s **LADA code** to automatically add it to local numbers.

## Features
- Removes **044**, **045**, **01**, and **1** prefixes from your contacts.
- Automatically adds the **+52** country code to national numbers.
- Adds your entered **LADA code** to local numbers.
- Keeps international numbers intact.
- Does not store or share your personal information.
